Loan Eligibility Prediction – Machine Learning Classification Project

This is a Machine Learning Classification project where I developed a real-time loan eligibility prediction system. The model analyzes customer details and identifies applicants who are more likely to be eligible for a loan, enabling efficient and accurate approval decisions.

The dataset contains customer attributes such as:
1. Gender
2. Marital Status
3. Education Level
4. Number of Dependents
5. Applicant & Co-applicant Income
6. Loan Amount & Loan Term
7. Credit History
8. Property Area

The objective is to build a model that predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on these features.

Target Variable:
Y -> Loan Approved
N -> Loan Not Approved

The model is trained using historical data to make accurate predictions for new loan applicants.

Data Preprocessing:
Various preprocessing techniques were applied, including:
1. Missing value imputation
2. Outlier treatment
3. Encoding categorical variables

Algorithms Used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost

Model Evaluation:
The best-performing model was evaluated using K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure consistency and reduce variance in results.
